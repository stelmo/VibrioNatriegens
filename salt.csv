CF(1) has five subunits: alpha(3), beta(3), gamma(1), delta(1), epsilon(1). CF(0) has three main subunits: a(1), b(2) and c(9-12). The alpha and beta chains form an alternating ring which encloses part of the gamma chain. CF(1) is attached to CF(0) by a central stalk formed by the gamma and epsilon chains, while a peripheral stalk is formed by the delta and b chains. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_01346}.",atpA,F0F1 ATP synthase subunit alpha,3.A.2.1
